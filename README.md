# project-boilerplate
This is a ruby script that helps automate my workflow.  It sets up a default project structure and a package.json/grunt-file with tasks to automagically compile scss and js.  

1. make sure you have grunt-cli and npm installed globally
2.  run the boilerplate script in the directory where you want your project. ( ruby boilerplate.rb )
3.  install grunt in that directory
4.  run npm install
5.  grunt watch to watch your sass and js.
